    <h2>What is programming?</h2>

    <p>It consists of the process of writing precise and detailed instructions in a <b>programming language</b>, so that a computer can perform a specific task.</p>
    <p>These instructions are called <strong>code, and they are organized logically so that the computer can understand and execute them.</strong></p>
    <p>The fundamental objective of programming is to create software, which is a <i>set of programs or applications</i> that allow computers to perform various tasks and functions.</p>
    <p>These tasks can range from <em>mathematical calculations to the execution of complex applications such as word processors, games, mobile applications, operating systems, design software, among others.</em></p>
    <p><mark>What is a programming language?</mark> It is a set of rules and symbols that allow programmers to write instructions that a computer can understand and execute.</p>
    <p>These languages act as intermediaries between <small>human language</small>, which we use to communicate, and <small>machine language</small>, which is the set of binary instructions that a computer understands directly.</p>
    <p>Instead of having to communicate with a computer using <del>complex</del> machine code, programmers can use high-level programming languages that more closely resemble human language.</p>
    <p>These <ins>languages are easier to understand and write</ins>, allowing programmers to focus on the logic and design of their programs rather than dealing directly with low-level details.</p>
    <p>Among the most used programming languages are: Python, Java, C<sub>+</sub><sub>+</sub> and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Among the data types that are usually found in various <sup>programming languages</sup> are:</p>
    <p><b>Integers, Numbers with decimals, Character, String, Boolean, List, Array and Class.</b></p>
